# Semgrep-project

Hello! This repository contains all files for the Semgrep Take-Home Project. These include:

1. A Jupyter notebook file named `Cohere_testing.ipynb`, which contains all phases of testing for the LLM to predict YAML rule metadata.
2. A plain-text file called `testing_data.txt`, which was used to train a custom LLM.
3. A second Jupyter file with code used for engineering the training data.

Thanks for your time and consideration!
